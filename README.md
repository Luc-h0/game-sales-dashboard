# Game Sales Dashboard & Portfolio

## Overview
This Streamlit-based multi-page application serves as a comprehensive video game sales dashboard while also featuring my personal CV and a cover letter tailored for a Game Data Analyst position at VNG Corporation. The dashboard analyzes video game sales data from `vgsales.csv`, sourced from vgchartz.com. Additionally, the CV and cover letter showcase my expertise and passion for game analytics.

  - Sales performance metrics
  - Top-selling games
  - Platform and publisher analysis
  - Market trends and segmentation
